                    Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                    Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs,
                    chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, 
                    and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                    Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, 
                    such as roasts, short ribs or steak
                    (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), 
                    while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky).

                <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice,
                though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. 
                Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.
